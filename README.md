🚀 Hello World! I'm Sean Byrne, a passionate coder, physicist, and veteran on a mission to explore the intersections of science, technology, and the cosmos. Here's a glimpse into my universe:

🌐 Explorer of Codes: Armed with a background in nuclear physics, biomolecular science and astronomy, I navigate the realms of code and the cosmos. My GitHub is a space where lines of code and constellations converge.
 | Python | C++ | ROOT | bash | Open for more |
 
🔬 Scientific Alchemist: In the laboratory, I unravel the mysteries of nuclear physics and biomolecular science. My repositories reflect the alchemy of science, where data transforms into discoveries, and code executes experiments.
🇺🇸 USMC Veteran Turned Developer: As a proud United States Marine Corps (USMC) veteran, I bring military precision to my coding. Discipline, teamwork, and problem-solving are not just principles; they're keystrokes in my coding journey.

💡 Innovation Catalyst: I believe in pushing boundaries and fostering innovation. My GitHub is a canvas where ideas take shape, from algorithmic experiments to scientific simulations. Always open to starting a new project in a new language.

🌍 Open Source Advocate: Committed to the spirit of collaboration, many of my projects embrace the open-source ethos. Join me in building a community where knowledge is freely shared, and collaboration knows no boundaries.

🔗 Connect : Whether you're a fellow coder, scientist, or science enthusiast, let's collaborate. Connect with me, fork a repository, or share your thoughts—let's code our way through the universe!
