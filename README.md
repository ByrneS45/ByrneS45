 I'm Sean Byrne, a USMC Veteran and nuclear physics PhD candidate :

 As a USMC veteran, I started my 20's learning the limits I could push myself. I developed discipline, leadership, teamwork, mentorship skills alongside other military skills.
 After completing my active duty contract, I pursued a dual bachelor's degree in Physics and Biomolecular Science, along with minors in Mathematics and Chemistry.
 In both undergraduate and graduate school I have tutored and taught courses in all of the above subjects.
 My summers were/are dedicated to growth: I participated in the Warrior-Scholar Project, conducted observational astronomy research at Yale, completed a biomolecular REU at Northeastern, and carried out NASA-funded research in observational astronomy.
 Currently I am a PhD candidate at UMass Lowell (UML) doing experimental physics in nuclear astrophysics.
 Contributing to projects at national laboratories like FRIB and Argonne. My research focuses on nuclear reaction rates relevant to astrophysical environments, using tools such as gamma-ray spectroscopy and particle accelerators.
 Most of my coding is for educational, academic or research purposes. Majority of my effort goes into data aquisition and anlysis working with a variety of detector systems.
 I have experience in:
 
 | Python | C++ | ROOT | Radware | bash | IRAF | Mathmatica | R | Open for more |
 | MESA | WinNet | OneZonerp | RatesMC |


With a diverse and interdisciplinary background, I’ve developed a broad perspective, strong interpersonal skills, and a deep passion for solving complex scientific problems through collaborative research.
